# LinkedInWebApplicationASP.NET
In this project I was tasked with creating a web application using asp.net and linking that to a database.
It was theoretically supposed to be used for keeping track of progress updates.


When this application first loads you are presented with a sign in screen. On this screen you must enter your the appropriate email, which is testemail@volstate.edu, and the appropriate password, which is for ease of testing Passw0rd!.
The imaginary user is names John Smith.
After the correct email password combination the user clicks the sign in button and is redirected to the next page.

The next page shows the user's name at the top and displays a grid with the name of the user and the message.
